	PANIK PRIORITY:
		ACCESSIBILITY:			
			destruction effect for ships
			change target selection to press+hold
			click flashes cannon range as cylinder + possible active target
			show cannonballs?

		GAME:	
			(disable unlimited range on PCannon?)
			support multiple ship types to spawn
			make crew reinforcement as: click on button -> click on cannon

	NECESSITIES:

	GOOD-TO-HAVE:
		crew reinforcements arriving and walking handled in its own independent object and script -> tells reinforceable cannonStation to do CrewReinforced() when timely
			new crews get shipped in with a destructible barge
		local scoreboard with 3-letter names :D		
		Ships have direction vector to next destination -> move faster towards destination the closer they are to facing forward toward dest

	FIXES/OPTIMIZATIONS:
		Don’t hide distancetotarget in code, make it public var
			Ships have cannon range based on ship scale -> smaller ships want closer and bigger ships stay back		
		Separate UI from game logic
		Use enums to determine faction of target(s) (maybe don’t use tags)
		Make game more approachable

	NICE-TO-HAVE:
		wind; a small force that turns rotation every now and then and lightly pushes all ships into one direction to add a random element		
		make ship want to turn its side to cannon when in range	
			only fire if shipSideTowardsCannon == true	
		AI has budget (e.g. 3; smol ship = .5gp, big ship = 1gp: 3 big / 6 small / 2 big 2 small)
			AI measures player's threat level and scales its own budget according to that
			how to decide what AI spawns? random? cooldown for each type of ship to spawn?
			AI budget has small extra variable that is added to budget and scales over time (to make failure inevitable at some point)
