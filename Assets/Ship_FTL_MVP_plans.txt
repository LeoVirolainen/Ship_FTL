CANNON SHOOTING 

if loadTimer <= 0f -> loaded = true

if active target != null
if loaded == true
	Fire();

	Fire(){
	make a random check if hit or no hit
	
	if hit:
	Show fake projectile
	Show impact
		target.HP - 1
	
	if !hit:
	Show fake projectile

	loaded = false
	(float) loadTimer = loadTime;
	}

	LOADING TIMER
		(in start) loadTimer = loadTime
		(in update) make necessary timer actions OR use coroutine?

TARGETING

make another ship to shoot
select active target (with 1, 2?)
active target GO fills cannonTarget variable
LookAt for cannon towards ship?

SHIP'S RETURN FIRE
base has big sphere trigger
	When ship inside trigger,
	(and cannon loaded (not urgent))
		fire at base

CANNON LOOKS AT SHIP

FIRING EFFECTS

NOTES:
	TO DO:
		AI select target based on proximity, not index 0 in list
		player target selection (1-9 keys)
		autofire
		ships fire at fort when close enough
		multicannon + multiship
		UI

	NICE TO HAVE:
		pick random cannon from ship when firing
		loading timer graphics
		active target graphics
		variable hit chance based on target distance
		moving ships
		multiple playercannon
