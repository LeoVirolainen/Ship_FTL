	PANIK PRIORITY:
		ACCESSIBILITY:
			destruction effect for ships
			UI event for selected/active cannon
			include targeting reticle also for selected ship in white line
			show valid ship target on mouseover (snap? make line go green from red)
			change target selection to press+hold
			click flashes cannon range as cylinder + possible active target
			click flashes ship range as cylinder
			Show ! icon on targetless cannon
			show cannonballs?
			loading timer graphics

		GAME:	
			(disable unlimited range on PCannon?)
			support multiple ship types to spawn

	NECESSITIES:
		Cannon health visualized as amount of crewmen

	GOOD-TO-HAVE:
		crew reinforcements arriving and walking handled in its own independent object and script -> tells reinforceable cannonStation to do CrewReinforced() when timely
			new crews get shipped in with a destructible barge
		local scoreboard with 3-letter names :D		
		Ships have direction vector to next destination -> move faster towards destination the closer they are to facing forward toward dest

	FIXES/OPTIMIZATIONS:
		Don’t hide distancetotarget in code, make it public var
			Ships have cannon range based on ship scale -> smaller ships want closer and bigger ships stay back		
		Separate UI from game logic
		Use enums to determine faction of target(s) (maybe don’t use tags)
		Make game more approachable

	NICE-TO-HAVE:
		wind; a small force that turns rotation every now and then and lightly pushes all ships into one direction to add a random element		
		make ship want to turn its side to cannon when in range	
			only fire if shipSideTowardsCannon == true	
		AI has budget (e.g. 3; smol ship = .5gp, big ship = 1gp: 3 big / 6 small / 2 big 2 small)
			AI measures player's threat level and scales its own budget according to that
			how to decide what AI spawns? random? cooldown for each type of ship to spawn?
			AI budget has small extra variable that is added to budget and scales over time (to make failure inevitable at some point)

	PSEUDO-CODE PLANS
		(this script in cannon parent, "Station")
		Cannon HP visualization as crew: "CannonCrew" (.cs)
			public ints crewHealth & maxCrewHealth (in start maxCrewHealth = crewHealth)
			
			in HPScript.takeDamage(), call crewScript.CrewDamaged()

			//only decreases amount of visible GOs when is hit -- how to restore?
			CrewDamaged()
		!!! THESE MUST BE ordered so that what we end up with is the right crewHealth value. hierarchy needed? start from lowest number
		!!! I THINK CREWHEALTH NEEDS TO BE "CREWDAMAGE" INSTEAD, FOR THE FOR-LOOP TO WORK AS INTENDED
				if currentHP >= ((maxHP / 4) * 3)	(so if current hp = higher than 75%)
					set crewHealth to 0
				if currentHP >= maxHP / 2			(so if current hp = higher than 50%)
					set crewHealth to 1
				if currentHP >= maxHP / 4			(so if current hp = higher than 25%)
					set crewHealth to 2
				if currentHP <= maxHP / 4			(so if current hp = lower than 25%)
					set crewHealth to 3
				if currentHP <= 0					(so if current hp <= 0)
					set crewHealth to 4
				
				for (int i = 0; i < crewhealth; ++i)
					crewArray[i].meshRenderer.isActive = false; //OR basically just a death animation that does !meshRenderer at end

				if (crewHealth == 4) { 
			CannonWiped()
			}
			
			CannonWiped() {
			Station.GameObject.FindObjectsInChildren("PCannonTransform").SetActive(false)
			}

		(this needs to be in its own object (cannon's parent? NEED NEW PARENT FOR THIS TO WORK :d CALL NEW PARENT "PCannonStation")
		CrewReinforced() { (only allows 100% restoration, but should work for now)

			StationToReinforce = the station you clicked before clicking "reinforce!"
				if (StationToReinforce.GameObject.FindObjectsInChildren("PCannonTransform") "is not active") //if the TransformGO is not active, make it active
					StationToReinforce.GameObject.FindObjectsInChildren("PCannonTransform").SetActive(true)
					//make all crewmen visible
				foreach(GameObject crewman in StationToReinforce.CrewScript.crewArray) {
					crewman.meshRenderer.isActive = true;	
					//set max crew Health
					StationToReinforce.GetComponent<CannonCrew>().crewHealth = maxCrewHealth;
					//set max HP
					StationToReinforce.GameObject.FindObjectsInChildren("PCannonTransform").GetComponent<HealthPoints>().hP = 
					StationToReinforce.GameObject.FindObjectsInChildren("PCannonTransform").GetComponent<HealthPoints>().maxhP;				
				}
