CANNON SHOOTING 

if loadTimer <= 0f -> loaded = true

if active target != null
if loaded == true
	Fire();

	Fire(){
	make a random check if hit or no hit
	
	if hit:
	Show fake projectile
	Show impact
		target.HP - 1
	
	if !hit:
	Show fake projectile

	loaded = false
	(float) loadTimer = loadTime;
	}

	LOADING TIMER
		(in start) loadTimer = loadTime
		(in update) make necessary timer actions OR use coroutine?

CANNON LOOKS AT SHIP

FIRING EFFECTS

NOTES:
	TO DO:
		Make destinationCol object check if collider is myShipScript.gameObject, if not, don't do anything: fixes stranger ships entering cols that arent their own
		disable unlimited range on PCannon
		AI seeks target close to cannon if HP high, if HP less than 50%, seek target out of cannon range
		UI

	NICE TO HAVE:
		loading timer graphics
		active target graphics
		variable hit chance based on target distance
		moving ships
