Minimum viable product:

HP SYSTEM
Ship HP
Cannon HP

(one script)
public int HP
when HP <= 0 -> gameobject.SetActive = false

CANNON SHOOTING (coroutine? ask Turkka)
press X to make ship active target for cannon

if loadTimer <= 0f -> loaded = true

if active target != null
if loaded == true
	Fire();

	Fire(){
	make a random check if hit or no hit
	
	if hit:
	Show fake projectile
	Show impact
		target.HP - 1
	
	if !hit:
	Show fake projectile

	loaded = false
	(float) loadTimer = loadTime;
	}

	LOADING TIMER
		(in start) loadTimer = loadTime
		(in update) make necessary timer actions OR use coroutine?

SHIP'S RETURN FIRE
base has big sphere trigger
	When ship inside trigger,
	(and cannon loaded (not urgent))
		fire at base

CANNON LOOKS AT SHIP

FIRING EFFECTS

NOTES:
	LOADING SYSTEM NOT URGENT
		FOR STARTERS, JUST SHOOT ONCE (use boolean to trigger only once)
