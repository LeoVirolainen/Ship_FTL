	TO DO:
		UI:
			UI icon for selected/active cannon
			include targeting reticle for selected ship in white line
			show valid ship target (snap? make line go green from red)
		GAME:	
DONE		automatic ship target seeking/selection + scouting interval float
			(disable unlimited range on PCannon?)

	UPCOMING:
		cannon crews take damage -> less crew = slower loading
DONE	get money from killing ships
		use money to hire more crews
			new crews get shipped in with a destructible barge
		
DONE	ship muzzle flash towards enemy
		only fire if shipSideTowardsCannon == true
			make ship want to turn its side to cannon when in range

		wind; a small force that turns rotation every now and then and lightly pushes all ships into one direction to add a random element

		local scoreboard with 3-letter names :D

		AI has budget (e.g. 3; smol ship = .5gp, big ship = 1gp: 3 big / 6 small / 2 big 2 small)
			how to decide what AI spawns? random? cooldown for each ship to spawn?
		AI measures player's threat level and scales its own budget according to that
		AI budget has small extra variable that is added to budget and scales over time (to make failure inevitable at some point)

	FIXES/OPTIMIZATIONS:
		Don’t hide distancetotarget in code, make it public var
			Ships have cannon range based on ship scale -> smaller ships want closer and bigger ships stay back
		Ships have direction vector to next destination -> move faster towards destination the closer they are to facing forward toward dest
		Separate UI from game logic
		Use enums to determine faction of target(s) (maybe don’t use tags)
		Make game more approachable

	NICE TO HAVE:
		loading timer graphics
		active target graphics
		JUICE:
			destruction effect for ship and cannon
